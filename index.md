# PROJECTS:

## Deadlinr - (Class Project - Team)	Spring 2022

Mobile-based application. Build around calendars and deadlines. Allows students to create calendars for courses or groups and then add their own deadlines to the calendar. Provides a solution where end users can work together to set deadlines through group voting on deadline. UI is based around calendars so users can easily learn how much time they have to complete their goals. Displays statistics for difficulty, completion time, and average completion time for users to better grasp how much time to devote to a certain deadline.
Technologies Used: MERN Stack - MongoDB, ExpressJS, React Native, NodeJS

## Statsketball - (Class Project - 2 Person Team)	Fall 2020

Web-based application. that simulates the information needed for running an NBA franchise. It provides data on player and team stats. This includes in-season per game and aggregate data - box scores of each game and totals for the season. The application also gives schedule data for the current season and can hold multiple seasons of data.
Technologies Used: JavaScript, NodeJs, HTML, MySQL using Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

## BookNet - (Class Project - Team) Spring 2020

Web-based application. Linked together students at Purdue University trying to exchange or buy books for courses at a cheaper price than the bookstore. The platform allows a user to build out their currently held books and books needed. This will facilitate a match with other users. Once matched, users can send messages back and forth in the application to go over exchanges, cost, and where to meet.
Technologies Used: ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, Firebase, Google Books API

## Systems Programming - (Class Project - Individual)	Fall 2019
Shell Project:
Built a shell interpreter which is based on the bash and csh shells. Shell has the ability to parse and execute commands. Implemented common tools such as ctrl-c to stop a command and zombie elimination. Created subshells allowing the user to implement a complex command using shell output as the input to another command. Implemented additional tools including wildcarding and command line editor mode
Technologies Used: C/C++
have 2-3 other project that would be good to put for this course

## Web Development Course - (Class Projects - Individual) Fall 2021
(3-4 total - need to look up and put onto this page)
Technologies Used: ReactJS, etc.

## Operating Systems - (Class Projects - Individual) Fall 2020
4-6 projects or possible put as 1 big project with parts broken out
